	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>The Millionaire Next Door is a 1996 book by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko. This book is a compilation of research done by the two authors in the profiles of 'millionaires' (note the term 'millionaire' denotes U.S. households with net-worths exceeding one million dollars (USD)).</p>
	<p>The authors compare the behaviour of those they call UAWs (Under Accumulators of Wealth) and those who are PAWs (Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth). Their findings, that millionaires are disproportionately clustered in middle-class and blue collar neighborhoods and not in more affluent or white-collar communities, came as a surprise to the authors who anticipated the contrary.</p>
	<p>Stanley and Danko's book explains why, noting that high-income white-collar professionals are more likely to devote their income to luxury goods or status items, thus neglecting savings and investments.</p>
	<p>Focusing on critical financial aspects as like; How to save money, economical spending habits and passing on wealth to future generations like millionaires do; With the real-life stories of Millionaires, It serves as a learning curve for everyone reading it..</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
    <p>This book focuses more on the self-development. How we should use our mind and inner-resource to become much more than what can be measured by money. It is more about how we can develop internally to achieve success and wealth. How our daily thoughts and action makes us who we are. And how we can apply the philosophy of the great achievers and remove mental-obstructions to acquire riches.</p>
	<p>Honestly, I felt like reading a psychological book. The words are very rich which makes it difficult to understand for people who are not students of mind. Personally, I didn’t like the book too much and you might not want to read it if you don’t like high and rich words and most importantly if you hate psychology. The concept is good but the presentation is not. Hence, I'll give this book a 3/5 rating.</p>
