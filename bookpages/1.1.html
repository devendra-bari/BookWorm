	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. WHY is not money or profitâ€”those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders, but not others?</p>
	<p>Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.</p>
	<p>Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire. This book is for anyone who wants to inspire others or who wants to find someone to inspire them.</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>The author argues that if we start with Why, we are likely to see a lot more positive results. I strongly recommend this book if you have not done so. It is bound to give you a fresh perspective on how you went about doing things and could trigger a lot of ideas.</p>
	<p>I strongly recommend this book if you have not done so. It is bound to give you a fresh perspective on how you went about doing things and could trigger a lot of ideas. I give this book 3.5/5 stars.</p>
