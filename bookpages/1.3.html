	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>Who Moved My Cheese? An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life, published on September 8, 1998, is a motivational business fable. The text describes change in one's work and life, and four typical reactions to those changes by two mice and two "Littlepeople", during their hunt for cheese...</p>
	<p>Who Moved My Cheese? features four characters: two mice, "Sniff" and "Scurry," and two Littlepeople, human metaphor, "Hem" and "Haw." (The names of the Littlepeople are taken from the phrase "hem and haw," a term for indecisiveness.) They live in a maze, a representation of one's environment, and look for cheese, representative of happiness and success.</p>
	<p>Initially without cheese, each group, the mice and humans, paired off and traveled the lengthy corridors searching for cheese. One day both groups happen upon a cheese-filled corridor at "Cheese Station C." Content with their find, the humans establish routines around their daily intake of cheese, slowly becoming arrogant in the process.</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>A New York Times business bestseller upon release, Who Moved My Cheese? remained on the list for almost five years and spent over 200 weeks on Publishers Weekly's hardcover nonfiction list. It has sold more than 26 million copies worldwide in 37 languages and remains one of the best-selling business books.</p>
	<p>I strongly recommend this book for beginners as it is motivational and talks straight to the point. It helps us to adapt to the changes in both personal and work  life. The book tells us in order to achieve something one must keep going rather than just hoping we could achieve someday using a metaphor. It also emphasises on moving on for a better change and also to be a good friend who consistently helps their friends to move on too...</p>
