	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>The Author, Jay Shetty has had phenomenal success and it is clear that his way of thinking, daily routines, practices and habits have helped shape this success. He uses lots of anecdotes of his journey and combines with references to ancient texts to highlight concepts and practices.</p>
	<p>The combination of anecdotes, ancient text references, exercises and diagrams really help to bring out the concepts but most importantly provide a practical framework to use.</p>
	<p>Jay is a powerful storyteller and he uses the power of story nicely in the book. Just like any other self-development book, it does have concepts that you would have seen in other books. Lots of people know about Morning Rituals and Gratitude but they still find it difficult to apply these on a daily basis.</p>
	<p>This Book provides great frameworks which combine ancient wisdom with the practicalities of living in the modern world. Jay was a Monk for 3 years and he is able to bring to life stories which show how he developed his thinking, what the book is all about!!</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
	<p>What I love is how humble Jay in his writing, he applies thinking like a Monk through his writing. The book does not preach, it just lays out several different concepts and puts a "Try this" frame around it.</p>
    <p>If you want to have more conscious, purposeful living then I highly recommend this book. Remember though, reading the book itself will not change your thinking, it will be practical aspects of reflecting and trying out the various concepts within which will support you with your personal growth.</p>
	<p>This book provides some simple but really powerful ways to change your thinking which will help you train your mind for peace and purpose every day. I, personally liked the meditation examples and also the Vedic Personality Test in the Appendix. It's really an worthy and wonderful Book which deserves a rating of 4.5/5 for sure!</big></p>
