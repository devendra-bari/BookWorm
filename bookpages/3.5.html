	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></h3></big>
	<big>
	<p>The Richest Man In Babylon gives common sense financial advice which you can apply today, told through tales and parables from the times of ancient Babylon.</p>
	<p>This book  is a 1926 book by George S. Clason that dispenses financial advice through a collection of parables set 4,000 years ago in ancient Babylon. The book remains in print almost a century after the parables were originally published, and is regarded as a classic of personal financial advice.</p>
	<p>The Core message of this book in few phrases is...<br>Save at least 10 percent of everything you earn and do not confuse your necessary expenses with your desires. Work hard to improve your skills and ensure a future income because wealth is the result of a reliable income stream. You cannot arrive at the fullest measure of success until you crush the spirit of procrastination within you.</p>
	<p>This book mainly discusses the secrets of wealth used by the ancient civilisations of the world. The book deals with different areas of finances including how to plan financially for your life, how to deal with your personal wealth and finally how this impacts your life.</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
	<p>This Book is entertaining, interesting and thought provoking and but most of all for me, inspiring. If you don't have problems with spending too much money then can still get an edge by reading the book.</p>
	<p> I found it interesting when applied to business and without a doubt there are lessons, even if common sense. It is a classic in of its own deserving of its well-regarded status of one of the classics of personal and business finance.</p>
	<p>If you are looking for traditional, actionable and effective financial wisdom; then this book is perfect for you. The author shares invaluable lessons from the point of view of a very rich man named Arkad. Babylon was the wealthiest city in the ancient world and Arkad was the richest man living in that city. I'll give this book a 4/5 rating, for sure!! </p>
