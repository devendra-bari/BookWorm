	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>“Eat that frog!” means to start your day with the biggest, most important, and most dreaded task. It's also the task you are most likely to procrastinate on. Brian Tracy is also about disciplining yourself to eat that frog first thing in the morning every single day.</p> 
	<p>Your ‘frog’ is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on if you don’t do something about it. The first rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first. </p>
	<p>Continually remind yourself that one of the most important decisions you make each day is what you will do immediately and what you will do later if you do it at all.</p>
	<p>The second rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat a live frog at all, it doesn’t pay to sit and look at it for very long. The key to reaching high levels of performance and productivity is to develop the lifelong habit of tackling your major task first thing each morning.</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
	<big>
	<p>To be honest, I didn’t really like the book much. It says number one best seller but I still don’t understand how. The same point has been stretched to a book. Breaking your biggest task into chunks, start on with the work asap, plan the day etc. </p>
	<p>There are 21 points of removing procrastination out which 3-4 points mean the same but has different words. Abd 2-3 points towards the end of the book are contradictory.</p>
	<p>But, being a bestseller and a precise 'to the point' book; which makes it an antidote for really someone dealing with habit of procrastination and want to overcome it.<br> For that useful reason, I'll rate this book, 3/5.</big></p>
