	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>The Alchemist is a story of a shepherd, Santiago, who leaves his flock and his land to pursue his dream. A boy who is on a journey of discovering his destiny and realising his dream of finding a treasure. </p>
	<p>It is rich in fiction and clearly crafted by Paulo Coelho to make more perfect. It is about following your dream and goal and achieving it; while doing so the whole universe conspires for its happening. The book has received the Niels Golden book award for its outstanding sales in the retail markets of UK.</p>
	<p>All the ideas and concepts which Santiago learns in his journey were perfectly inspiring, the most important one was the idea of love without ownership , the concept of love as distinct from possession. He loves a girl of dessert, Fatimah, who proves that true love is the one which encourages you to pursue your dreams and destiny because true love does not demand possession or ownership. It’s always there no matter where you are.</p>
	<p>It's special feature is that it talks a lot about the 'Soul of the World' which attracts people towards their goals.  When a person strives to live his dream, nature helps him out to seek his dream; as written in The Alchemist:<br>“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”</p>
	</big><br>
