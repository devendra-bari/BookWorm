	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari was published in 1997 by Harper Collins Publishers, and has sold more than three million copies as of 2013. A recent translation to Dogri language was done by Champa Sharma.</p>
	<p>Sharma also wrote several other books in the series, such as The Secret Letters Of The Monk Who Sold His Red Ferrari, Leadership Wisdom from the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, Discover Your Destiny with the Monk who sold his Ferrari and Family Wisdom from the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari.</p>
	<p>The book is written in the form of a conversation between two friends. The story is about Julian Mantle who is a successful lawyer but is full of tension and work pressure, who finally decides to leave his luxuries and baggage of past and goes to Himalayan mountain in search of peace. Julian narrates his spiritual experiences during a Himalayan journey which he undertook after selling his holiday home and red Ferrari.</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
	<p>Probably the best book I ever read till date. Learnings and different virtues which have been described in the book are tremendous. Each word of this book is a gem. If you are struggling with life and yet to find a purpose, then this book is for you. </p>
	<p>A fun conversation between a "reformed attorney" and his protege. It is a story that brings to bear "7 Timeless Virtues of Enlightened Living." Overall I enjoyed it very much. The virtues caused me to think about my own life and where I'm trying to go. Personally, I think it is a worthwhile read for anyone who is trying to improve their lives and those around them.</p>
	<p>Its truly a book that has the potential to change lives. Just the thing is, the fictionizing of a self help book make it a bit ambiguous about its Genre. But, Give it a read and you won't regret it. Very well written. I'll rate this book 3.5/5, for that reason.
