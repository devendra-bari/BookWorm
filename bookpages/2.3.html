	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
	<big>
    <p>"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" is a called a classic for a reason: It's beautifully written, insightful, and Francie's story is timeless.</p>
	<p>My most recent "classic" to be checked off my list! I can truly understand why this is such a beloved classic that has enchanted millions of readers for the last eight decades! The raw honesty in the portrayal of the Nolan family and their struggles and their connectedness is what will make people keep coming back and back again to this story!</p>
	<p>Betty Smith did an exceptional job with the book. However, there are too many adult components of this turn-of-the-century novel to make it appropriate for youngsters. Plus, reading this book after some life experience adds to the appreciation of the story and characters.</p>
	<p>I just really enjoyed reading it and noting many great insights. It's really an wonderful and fantastic book & deserves a rating of 4/5.</big></p>
