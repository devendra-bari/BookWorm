	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill examines the psychological power of thought and the brain in the process of furthering your career for both monetary and personal satisfaction. Originally published in 1937, this is one of the all-time self-help classics and a must read for investors and entrepreneurial types.</p>
	<p>Napoleon Hill researched more than forty millionaires to find out what made them the men that they were. In Think and Grow Rich, he imparts that knowledge to you. Also he discusses about whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.</p>
	<p>Think And Grow Rich is a state of mind. It exploits the power of thought to manifest strong desires and a definite purpose into reality. Turning your all-consuming obsession (definite purpose) into a reality is not an easy task. However, if the desire is strong and youâ€™re willing to raise the stakes, you will win. The author projects the following formula:</p>
	<em>Desire + Ideas + Plans + Massive Action = Success</em>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
	<big>
	<p>Its highly effective book for those who deeply desire to become a rich . This is book give the real live example of some the great peoples of the history like Thomas Edison , henry fords etc . I think it will also inspire you to become a great man too.</p>
	<p>I consider this book for those who have really hard time in life and struggling financially . This book has dozens of real life stories of such peoples who started of by nothing just struggling but become world top scientist , inventors, economist , leader etc.</p>
	<p>This book inspire more, than give ideas. I truly appreciate the work and effort of Napoleon because it might has taken few year to gathered such real life stories of world top famous peoples in the history. Which truly deserves an 4.5/5 rating, for sure!!</big></p>
