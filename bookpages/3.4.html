	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>The Intelligent Investor is based on value investing, an investment approach Graham began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently refined with David Dodd. The Intelligent Investor also marks a significant deviation to stock selection from Graham's earlier works, such as Security Analysis. </p>
	<p>The book mainly discusses the Idea...To be an intelligent investor, you must be patient, disciplined, and eager to learn new things. You must also be able to control your emotions and to think for yourself. Graham states that the intelligence needed to be a good investor has much more to do with character than it does IQ.</p>
	<p>In ‘The Intelligent Investor,’ little time is spent discussing the technique of analyzing securities. Instead, great focus is placed on investment principles and investors’ attitudes. Although ‘The Intelligent Investor’ was first published in 1949, the underlying principles of good investment do not change from decade to decade.</p>
	<p>Consequently, the author aims to teach us three things:<br>How to minimize the chances of suffering irreversible losses; Maximize the chance of achieving sustainable wins and; Overcome self-defeating modes of thought that often prevent investors from reaching their full potential.</p>
	</big><br>
	
	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
	<p>Great read! Definitely earned its title of being the "Bible of Investing". The book isn't much of an easy read though, given the english used is kind of old English sentence construction. </p>
	<p>However, I do find the concepts pretty interesting. And I love how he supports everything with a study, that way he assures the readers that everything isn't so subjective. </p>
	<p>I liked how the author simplified investment concepts...Except for the bit reason of English, which sometimes lead you to ambiguity. But, the book is worth a read if you're an Investment seeker or enthusiast. It will leave you feeling an exhilarating pleasure; of knowing the next steps to take. For that reason...I'll rate this book 3.5/5</p>
