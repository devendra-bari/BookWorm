	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>Originally published in 1936, How to Win Friends and Influence People is one of the greatest self-help books of all time. Written by Dale Carnegie, the book contains the fundamental principles of social interactions and effective techniques of dealing with people.</p> 
	<p>It provides all the tips you'll ever need to build strong personal and professional relationships. Up to date real-world examples are included. If you've already read the original, this summary will serve as a reminder of main ideas and key concepts. If you haven't, don't worry, this summary contains everything you need to know without having to use so much time to read the original book.</p>
	<p>The core idea is that you can change other people's behavior simply by changing your own. It teaches you the principles to better understand people, become a more likable person, improve relationships, win others over, and influence behavior through leadership.</p>
	<p>'But how do we find time to read and remember all 214 pages?' No worries!

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
	<p>From a management perspective, this book is pure gold. And I can say this because, throughout the months that I invested in reading it, I actually applied many principles at my day to day life, and saw the results visibly. Even though this book was written a century ago, and most of the political examples look like just stories without much context, the principles are still relevant in today's time as much as any time before.</p>
	<p>If you truly want to get something out of it, take the advice from the initial section! Don't just turn the pages away in a day or two, apply the principles as you read, slowly. Observe the effects, and decide what works best for you. </p>
	<p>However, if you're going for real, personal friendships, IMO, the times have changed, and in that regard, this book just tells you how to be a people pleaser rather than gaining a true friend, so to speak. On that note, I will give book a 4/5 rating.</p>
