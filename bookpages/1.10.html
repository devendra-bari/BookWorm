	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>Gaur Gopal Das and his wealthy young friend Harry get talking, delving into concepts ranging from the human condition to finding one's purpose in life and the key to lasting happiness.</p>
	<p>Whether you are looking at strengthening your relationships, discovering your true potential, understanding how to do well at work or even how you can give back to the world, Gaur Gopal Das takes us on an unforgettable journey with his precious insights on these areas of life.</p>
	<p>Das is one of the most popular and sought-after monks and life coaches in the world, having shared his wisdom with millions. His debut book, Life's Amazing Secrets, distils his experiences and lessons about life into a light-hearted, thought-provoking book that will help you align yourself with the life you want to live.</p>
	<p>This book is equally fun as watching their videos inline with their wisdom. Since it is in form of a dialogue between two people it is very relatable and covers small and subtle important matters of day to day life...</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
	<p>It's such a beautifully written, easy read but with a lot of principles that are applicable in day to day life. I have been able to forgive my past wrecks by reading this book and this has given me a direction to how to think of the others as well! Incredibly written with subtle sarcasm!!</p> 
	<p>In my opinion,  the book is absolutely a must read ! The writer has presented the 4 wheels of car like life in a fascinating way. Each chapter has a story with a conclusion in the end which never deterred my urge to read more.</p>
	<p> The stories he had cited,  some are real,  some are mythical but all are intriguing and engaging . I would like to give the author and the overall book a 5/5 rating...for its phenomenal and fantastic work.</p>
