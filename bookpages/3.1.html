	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and the father of his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The Book discusses not only about how you don’t need to earn a high income to be rich, but also how rich people make money work for them.</p>
	<p>The first half of the book is a fun story on the conversations with both his dads (well, one is biological and the other is his financial dad). These conversations are nice because the innocent questions little Robert asks would be the same that many readers would have while they are reading through the book. Rich dad explains the ideas the rich have to maintain and grow their wealth so consistently. </p>
	<p>The second half is how you should think about the situation you are in and how you can improve it. Do you just give up as a kid because your parents don't give you an allowance while little Jimmy gets $50 from his parents each week? You should be willing to think and work harder than 99% of the population if you want to be in the 1%! </p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
	<big>
    <p>Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published in 1997 and quickly became a must-read for people interested in investing, money, and the global economy. The book has been translated into dozens of languages, sold around the world, and has become the #1 Personal Finance book of all time.</p>	
	<p>The overarching theme of Rich Dad Poor Dad is how to use money as a tool for wealth development. It destroys the myth that the rich are born rich, explains why your personal residence may not really be an asset, describes the real difference between an asset and a liability, and much more.</p>
	<p>Highly recommend for people new to finances and saving :) I think this is a very well written book indeed as I have a clearer view on how to handle my own finance . This book had a clear cut on basic principle of what we need to have in our mindset to succeed . A person commented to go college and learn theory, I would say this book contain all those expensive colleges would offer to a student. I'll rate this book 4/5.</p>
