	<big><h3><em>Summary :-</em></big></h3>
	<big>
	<p>The Great Gatsby is an essential commentary of the Jazz age- the gaudiest era in American history; the roaring twenties. F. Scott Fitzgerald portrayed America as it was losing its moral compass in a post-world war race to materialism besotted with a rapacious lifestyle.  </p> 
	<p>This is a book with intrigue and flawed characters struggling with a multitude of issues- coming to terms with one's past, frantically pursuing self-serving motives, decadence, oscillating between imagination and reality, unfulfilled dream, lost love, loneliness, romance, and tragedy. Gatsby is at the center of narrative whose obsession with his lady love navigates us through the American that has lost its moral compass. </p>
	<p>One can not afford to miss how this poignant tale of longing and disillusion will end. But, it is not only the love story that you are looking for. It is also the description on the dark side of a resplendent America in the 20s and how uncompromised avarice could lead to terrible consequences. Jay Gatsby is the character that will surely live with you for a long time after you complete reading.</p>

	<big><h3><em>Review :-</em></h3></big>
    <big>
	<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby", I knew was an amazing book, when I read it. One of my favorite parts is when Gatsby and Daisy finally reunite after spending time apart. It makes me feel like anyone could really meet someone from their past and pick right back up where they left off.</p>
    <p>I thought it was terrible how Gatsby's story had to end, what with him being shot and Daisy choosing to stay with Tom (who I loathe entirely), but other than some small problems I had with the vocabulary it was an amazing read and I would definitely check it out if you are interested in classic literature.</p>
	<p>One of my favorite classic books. Its such a detailed book about the 1920's time period and its really eye-catching. There's a bunch of romance and tragedy throughout the book, which can provide a lot of suspense for the audience. Hence, I'll thoroughly rate this book with an 4/5 rating.</big></p>
